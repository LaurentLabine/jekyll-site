  text:
      - My <b>interpersonal and relationship building skills</b> helped my co-workers realize that I was available for them and that I could help them achieve much more as a team than they would as an individual. <br/>
        Always willing to help, my <b>excellent leadership skills</b> have proven themselves useful many times when they would rely on me to help them reach their potential.
        Torough time, I also developped <b>strong communication skills</b> in order to listen effectively to my managers, co-workers or clients, communicate and facilitate discussions effectively with my team mates, prepare and deliver presentations, write documentation and so forth.
      - Being the critical thinker I am, my <b>very efficent researching skills</b> and my ability to unterstand things quickly sometimes put me in a position of mentor towards my team as I can easily analyse situations from multiple viewpoints and research matters to define key issues and explain them.
      - Overall, I am a <b>flexible team player</b> who prospers in a fast-paced, but organized, team work environment.

  title: Technical Skills
  quote: The only source of knowledge is experience.
  quote_author: Albert Einstein
  text:
      - My technical expertize is very wide due to the multiple aspects of the work experience I have acquired over time.<br>
        While I do have a very extensive knowledge of <b>telecommunications, server infrastructures and carrier-grade network design & build</b>, I also gathered many other skills in other domains such as <b>software developpement</b> and <b>electronics</b>.
      - My prefered networking toolkit consists of <b>Juniper JunOS</b> routers running <b>BGP</b> and <b>OSPF</b> protocols and use technologies such as <b>MPLS</b> based L2 and L3 <b>VPN</b>s. <b>Traffic engineering</b> and <b>QoS</b> have no secrets for me.<br>
        I have very extensive knowledge of <b>CWDM</b> and <b>DWDM</b> fiber networks and actually know how to splice fiberoptic cables and manage <b>outside plant</b> fiber networks.
        Wireless (microwave) networking technologies have also become something I am very familiar with, using <b>Ubiquiti networks</b> antennaes, I've achieved links of great distance to provide <b>high availability</b> solutions to customers.
      - Having worked with highly available and scalable network infrastructures, I became quite familiar with their server counteparts using <b>micro services architectures</b> and <b>distributed computing</b> technologies.
      - <b>Python (3.5+)</b> is my language of choice to code pretty much everything backend but I am also versed in <b>Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, HTML</b> and others.
