      - While I was at EBOX I was responsible of the restructuration and scalability of everything IT -
        EBOX was undergoing tremendous growth and I had to ensure the systems and network would survive it.
      - A new datacenter was under construction and I was part of the small team responsible of it's realization through the different vendors and contractors.
        Many aspects were under my supervision such as power requirements (Generators, UPSes, etc) HVAC, Acces control, etc. I had to make sure everything was built to wisthand future usage of the datacenter by EBOX and its current and future customers.
      - I also managed the developpement and designed an authentication and access control system for a client-facing service.
        The system restricts content depending on a client's subscription and limits the number of devices a client can use to access the service.

      - The most significant project thorough my time as Director of R&D at ZEROFAIL was the design of a complex Network Operations and Business Support System consisting of:<br>
        A scalable, asynchonous RPC system built on the ZeroMQ messaging library so that workers can be added dynamically to scale to load without necessitating any changes to client configurations. -
        The python implementation leverages the new asynchronous programming tools available with recent versions of Python, including the new async/await syntax and the asynchronous iterator protocol.<br>
        An implementation using the above and a Graph Database system to enable very powerful queries to facilitate operations using the DataStax Enterprise database, especially the new DataStax Enterprise Graph.<br>
        Contribution of design ideas for the <a href="https://github.com/davebshow/goblin">"Goblin"</a> project (the lead developper being part of my team).
      - This system and many others I designed and built helped ZEROFAIL reach higher levels of efficiency and enabled new sources of revenue.

      text: But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and
            I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of
            the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to
            obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and
            pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
            physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man
            who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
            produces no resultant pleasure?
