      - While I was at EBOX I was responsible of the restructuration and scalability of everything IT -
        EBOX was undergoing tremendous growth and I had to ensure the systems and network would survive it.
      - A new datacenter was under construction and I was part of the small team responsible of it's realization through the different vendors and contractors.
        Many aspects were under my supervision such as power requirements (Generators, UPSes, etc), HVAC, Acces control, etc. I had to make sure everything was built to wisthand future usage of the datacenter by EBOX and its current and future customers.
      - I also managed the developpement and designed an authentication and access control system for a client-facing service.
        The system restricts content depending on a client's subscription and limits the number of devices a client can use to access the service.

      - The most significant project thorough my time as Director of R&D at ZEROFAIL was the design of a complex Network Operations and Business Support System.
      - A scalable, asynchonous RPC system was built on the ZeroMQ messaging library so that workers can be added dynamically to scale to load without necessitating any changes to client configurations. <br>
        The python implementation leverages the new asynchronous programming tools available with recent versions of Python, including the new async/await syntax and the asynchronous iterator protocol.<br>
      - The system also leveraged a Graph Database system to enable very powerful queries that were used to facilitate operations. DataStax Enterprise database was chosen for that purpose, especially the new DataStax Enterprise Graph (DSE).<br>
        To interface with DSE the <a href="https://github.com/davebshow/goblin">"Goblin"</a> project was contributed to (the lead developper being part of my team).
      - This OSS/BOSS project and many others I designed and built helped ZEROFAIL reach higher levels of efficiency and enabled new sources of revenue.

      - Due to the rapid growth of the telecommunication market in the Montreal area while I was Director of the Networking Group at ZEROFAIL, I had the opportunity to build a very extensive MPLS network accross Canada and the north of USA using cutting edge Juniper routers. <br>
        Very quickly, ZEROFAIL became a trusted source for connectivity services.
      - I designed the network to provide an edge over competition by making sure the whole infrastructure would have contingency plans in place in case of a problem - I wanted to build something that would stand by the name "ZEROFAIL".
      - To further improve the offering for highly available connectivity services, with the help of ZEROFAIL's CTO, I also designed and built the most extensive private wireless network in the metropolitain area of Montreal.<br>
      - Later on, ZEROFAIL added a portfolio of fiber connectivity services leveraging the concepts and technologies I had put in place.

      text: Due to the responsabilities I had at the moment with ZEROFAIL, it became too complex to attend to the courses and achieve results on par with my personal level of satisfaction. <br>
            I may continue the program in the future, but only time will tell.

      text: I successfuly completed all the classes in the program without any issues or fallouts.<br>
            Furthermore, the domain specific classes were all completed with grades way above the average. I was the best student of the cohort in that program.
