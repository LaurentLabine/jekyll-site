  - My personnal mission is to <b>make things, fix stuff and help others</b>.<br/> I just happenned to love working with high tech stuff so it became my area of expertise.
  - I am a <b>detail oriented</b> and <b>challenge driven</b> person so I never leave a stone unturned or a question unanswered. I care about what I do.<br/>
    Insatiably curious, I am a <b>quick and self taught learner</b> that thrives on learning new things.
    I take a <b>multi-disciplined approach</b> to my work, incorporating ideas from the several aspects of my skillset.
    Asking 'what if' is something I do as often as possible, making sure everything has been thought of, challenging myself and my team mates. I experiment constantly.
  - I have <b>10 years of experience</b> in telecommunications, server infrastructures and carrier-grade network design & build.<br>
    Bleeding edge software technologies have become parts of my toolset to create powerful and unique infrastuctures. I now eat DevOps for breakfast.<br/>
    Feel free to <a href="#sections-04-skills" class="page-scroll">Scroll down</a> for more details on my skillset.
  - The world is full of "things" waiting to be built, and I love being that guy who makes them appear. <br/>
    So, let's talk about that huge [problem/idea/project/goal] you dream of, and let's see how I can help!
