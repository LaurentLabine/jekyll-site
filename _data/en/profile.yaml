  - I like to think that my personnal mission is to <b>make things, fix stuff and help others</b>.<br/> I just happen to love working with high tech stuff so it became my area of expertise.
  - I am a <b>detail oriented</b> and <b>challenge driven</b> person so I never leave a corner untouched or a question unanswered. I care about what I do.<br/>
    Insatiably curious, I believe that I am a <b>quick and self taught learner</b> that thrives at the idea of learning something new.
    So, I usually take a <b>multi-disciplined approach</b> to my work incorporating many ideas from the different aspects of my skillset.
    Asking 'what if' has became something I do as often as possible, making sure everything has been thought of, challenging myself and my team mates, and experimenting constantly.
  - I have more than <b>9 years of experience</b> in telecommunications and server infrastructures.<br/>
    I specialize in infrastructure design and implementation and became very familiar with DevOps over time. Feel free to <a href="#sections-04-skills" class="page-scroll">Scroll down</a> for more details on my skillset.
  - I think the world is full of "things" waiting to happen and because I've seen it over and over again, I love being that person who makes them happen. So, let's talk about that huge [problem/idea/project/goal] that you'd like to see happen and let's see how I could help!
