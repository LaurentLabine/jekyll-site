  comment: Jo is one of the most brilliant people I know. For anything related to Linux, network, or project-managing complex ERP projects, I would ask nobody else.

    - Jonathan is definitely one of the smartest people I had the chance to work with. He excels in multiple fields, ranging from building a datacenter to designing a highly complex ERP system and anything in between.
    - He is not one to shy away from a challenge; on the contrary, he is constantly pushing himself to learn new things, or improve on what he already knows. To top it all off, he is always willing to help, and is always a fun guy to work with.
    - Jonathan was one of the reasons I was looking forward to going to work in the morning, and I hope I get to work with him again.

He's a great teacher, a team player and definitely a huge asset to have in your company!

      - I've worked under Jonathan's management on software and devops projects. He strives to produce quality results and to exceed expectations, and to that end he skillfully finds ways to play to his team's strengths. He has a talent for passing along his expertise, and makes good use of the expertise of others by listening and keeping an open mind to proposed solutions.
      - A real team player, Jonathan is usually the first to lend a hand when the need arises.
